Concept of Properties:

Properties are used to encapsulate the value of a private field. They use access specifiers, which gives better 
control to read, write, or manipulate a field’s value. It creates a sandbox over fields, which protects it from 
saving false data.

Full Property:
In full property, we declare private fields and encapsulate them inside a property’s definition.
•	 get property accessors used to return the value of a field.
•	 set property accessors used to set a value in a field.

Read Only Property:
•	 when there is only get property or set property is set as private.

Write only Property:
•	 when there is only set property or get property is set as private.
